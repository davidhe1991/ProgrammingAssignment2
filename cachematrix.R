## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
## The two functions below are used to create a special object that stores a numeric vector and caches its mean

## Write a short comment describing this function
## makeCacheMatrix function will create a special matrix object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function
## cacheSolve function computes the inverse of the special matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## then the cachesolve function retrieve the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
